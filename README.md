Rubric  Items:

Use two APIS: 
1. used tiwlio + used a random string genorator API

Use a framework:
1. used react

Mangage your own backend:
1. seperate backend that I am hosting at the following domain: iwantadomainplz.com
2. This is made with Flask, Served with NGINX, and is hosted with EC2.
3. I use an SQLite database to keep track of the number of users who have registered for my app
4. Tokens are permantnely with usernames which allows login. Once their username does not exist in react's "props" history, they are considered logged out. 



react apps that use browserrouters apparently struggle with github pages, so the working project is at: https://pacific-island-33860.herokuapp.com/login 

The app takes a long time to render if nobody has used it for a while, so try refreshing the page if it will raise some kind of grading concern
